<h2>About Myer-Briggs Type Indicator</h2>

<br> 

The Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a personality test that looks at an individual's pyschological preferences to place them into one of 16 distinct personality types, defined by preferences spanning along four dimensions:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Extroversion-Introversion (E-I)</b>: How you intertact with the world and gain energy from interactions -- by being inwardly focused (Introversion) or outwardly turned (Extroversion)?</li> <br>
  <li><b>Intutition-Sensing (N-S)</b>: How you process information -- based on the information itself (Sensing) or your own thoughts and interpretations about the information (Intuition)? </li><br>
  <li><b> Feeling-Thinking (F-T)</b>: How you make decisions -- based on logic and hard facts in search of the objective truth (Thinking) or on personal values and an inner sense of morality in search for harmony (Feeling)? </li><br>
  <li><b> Judging-Perceiving (J-P):</b> How you organize your time and incoming information -- in a structured, organized way seeing the world as more black and white (Judging) or in a flexible, adaptable way prefering to keep options open (Perceiving)? </li>
</ul>

Although the MBTI has been critized for poor reliability (i.e. producing different results when taken on different occasions by the same person) and not being entirely comprehension (due to neuroticism not being taken into account), it still remains one of the most popular online personality tests to date and is especially popular within the business sector.

The purpose of this project is to investigate whether patterns and predictive features can be extracted from the text to pinpoint an individual's personality type. The ability to use writing style and word usage to detect a person's personality might be a more precise and more reliable method of detecting pyscological preferences than self-reported tests.
